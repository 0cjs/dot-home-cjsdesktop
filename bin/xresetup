#  xresetup - (re-)do all idempotent X desktop setup, including env vars
#
#  This is intended to be sourced both on initial login and when
#  configuration or device changes cause the X11 configuration to be
#  changed from that as desired. Note that environment variables will
#  not be exported/updated unless the `source` or `.` command is used
#  in the calling shell. Use cases include:
#
#    1. The keyboard/mouse is changed or unplugged/repluged,
#       necessitating that the xmodmap and xinput pointer settings be
#       configured again.
#    2. The `.Xresources` file is changed and needs to be re-read.
#    3. Something changed the root window color and it needs to be
#       changed back.
#
#  N.B.: Since this script is often sourced, it must never itself exit,
#  as that will cause the calling shell to exit, perhaps preventing
#  login. it may, however, execute `return 1` or similar.

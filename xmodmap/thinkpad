! Caps Lock -> Ctrl
!--------------------------------------------------

! Caps_Lock (66) duplicates Control_L
!
  remove Control  = Control_L
  keycode 66      = Control_L
  add Control     = Control_L

! I don't rebind Control_L to Caps_Lock because I didn't use it much
! and it's more convenient for other users on my keyboard to leave it.
!
! remove Lock     = Caps_Lock
! keycode 37      = Caps_Lock
! add Lock        = Caps_Lock
!
! However, with no keys bound to it, we must clear it or it seems that
! Control_L will somehow stick to the Lock modifier as well. We must
! clear instead of remove to avoid error messages when this is run again.
!
clear Lock

! Swap ESC (9) and backquote/tilde (49)
!
  keycode 9 = quoteleft asciitilde
  keycode 49 = Escape

! Control_R as compose can be handy for Compose-E-Quote → é etc.
! But we don't do this because it's also the Virtualbox "escape from
! captured console" key; without it we can get badly stuck.
! keycode 105 =	Multi_key

! Japanese keyboard customizations
!--------------------------------------------------

! yen left of backspace
  keycode 132 = asciitilde yen
! underbar left of right-shift
  keycode 97 = grave underscore
  keycode 131 = Muhenkan Muhenkan Muhenkan
  keycode 129 = Henkan Mae_Koho Zen_Koho
  keycode 208 = Hiragana Katakana Romaji

! Thinkpad stuff
!--------------------------------------------------

! On new Thinkpad Compact Bluetooth/USB Keyboard with TrackPoint we have
! Home/End/Ins/Del in a row at the top right; it's nice to swap Home/End
! with Ins/Del because I use the former a lot and the latter little in
! areas where I don't even have Emacs keybindings. This actually looks
! ok on the older keyboards (with PgUp/PgDn at the very far right) using
! a more vertical orientation, but we'll see if we need to tweak
! differently for that later. These are in order left to right:
keycode 110 = Insert
keycode 115 = Delete
keycode 118 = Home
keycode 119 = End

! Hmm....funny thinkpad thing? This otherwise comes out as
! (keysym 0xfe03, ISO_Level3_Shift)...XKeysymToKeycode returns keycode: 92
keycode 108 = Alt_R

!keycode 51 = BackSpace
!keycode 22 = backslash bar

! On older ThinkPad keyboards, 135 seemed to be pause, but mapped funny.
! On the X61 it's Menu.
!keycode 135 = Pause

! Thinkpad "page" keys near arrow keys; laptop internal keyboards only
keycode 166 = Prior
keycode 167 = Next

! numlock for ThinkPad T42
keycode 77 = Num_Lock Num_Lock
